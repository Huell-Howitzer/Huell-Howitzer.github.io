                    Fold the main crease back up so that the two sides
                    match and cover each other.  Make a fold on each side
                    parallel to the crease and approximately one-fourth to one-
                    third of the width from the crease to the side.  These folds
                    should point away from each other and should form a flat
                    surface perpendicular to the main body.

                    `jazz up' your paper airplane, but are not essential to basic
                    flight.
